# IS437 Project Graham
## This will be a scheduling system that assigns referees to different sporting events. There will be an administrator as well as separate users for the referees that are in the system. The administrator will assign each user to an event. Once the event has finished the user will input the score to each match. Administrators will be allowed to use CRUD operations across all of the tables that are populated in the UI, and there will be five tables that can be used by the administrator. One of the user tables has the user ID, user type and the user’s password. The user will also be able to edit the event outcome field in the event table and also input their availability in the referee availability table. 

* General Use Cases:
 * User/ Administrator logs in
 * User/ Administrator logs out
 * User/ Administrator views the event 
 * Administrator views the users profile
 * User reports final score of the event
 
* Higher Level Use Cases:
 * Administrator creates user profile
 * Administrator updates user profile
 * Administrator creates events
 * Administrator assigns user to a event
 * Administrator deletes event
 * Administrator edits schedule to delete user from an event
